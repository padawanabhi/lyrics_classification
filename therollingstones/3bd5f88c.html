When I come home, baby
And I′ve been working all night long
I put my daughter on my knee, and she said
Daddy, what's wrong?
She whispered in my ear so sweet
You know what she said?

She said, ooh, daddy, you′re a fool to cry
You're a fool to cry
And it makes me wonder why

Daddy, you're a fool

You know, I′ve got a woman (daddy, you′re a fool)
And she live in the poor part of town
And I go see her sometimes
And we make love, so fine
I put my head on her shoulder
She said, tell me all your troubles
You know what she said?




She said, ooh, daddy, you're a fool to cry
You′re a fool to cry
And it makes me wonder why
Daddy, you're a fool
(Oh, I love you so much, baby)
Daddy, you′re a fool to cry
Daddy, you're a fool to cry

Yeah, she said, ooh, daddy, you′re a fool to cry
You're a fool to cry
And it makes me wonder why
She said, ooh, daddy you're a fool to cry
Ooh, daddy, you′re a fool to cry
Ooh, daddy, you′re a fool to cry
Ooh, daddy, you're a fool to cry
Even my friends say to me sometimes
I make out like I don′t understand them
You know what they say?
They say

Ooh, daddy, you're a fool to cry
You′re a fool to cry
And it makes me wonder why (why, why)

I'm a fool, baby, yeah
I′m a fool, babe, oh yeah
I'm a certified fool, yeah
Want, want to tell you, to tell you, babe




I'm a fool, baby, oh yeah
Certified fool, babe, yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on, yeah
I′m a fool, yeah
I′m a fool, yeah
I'm a fool
