Hannah honey was a peachy kind of girl

Her eyes were hazel
And her nose were slightly curved
We spent a lonely night at the Memory Motel
It′s on the ocean, I guess you know it well
It took a starry night to steal my breath away

Down on the water front
Her hair all drenched in spray

Hannah baby was a honey of a girl
Her eyes were hazel
And her teeth were slightly curved
She took my guitar and she began to play

She sing a song to me

Stuck right in my brain
You're just a memory
Of a love that used to be




You′re just a memory
Of a love that used to mean so much to me
• She got a mind of her own
And she use it well yeah
Well she's one of a kind
She's got a mind

•She got a mind of her own yeah
And she use it mighty fine
She drove a pick-up truck
Painted green and blue
The tires were wearing thin
She turned a mile or two
When I asked her where she headed for
"Back up to Boston I′m singing in a bar"
I got to fly today on down to Baton Rouge
My nerves are shot already

The road ain′t all that smooth

Across in Texas is the rose of San Antone
I keep on a feeling that's gnawing in my bones
You′re just a memory (just a memory)
Of a love that used to mean so much to me

You're just a memory
You′re just a memory (just a memory)




All the love that used to mean so much to me
You just a memory girl
You're just sweet of memory

That used to mean so much to me
Sha la la la...
You′re just a memory
All the live that used to mean so much to me
•She got a mind of her own
And she use it well yeah
Mighty fine, she's one of a kind
She got a mind of her own
One of a kind and she use it well
On the seventh day my eyes were all a glaze
We've been ten thousand miles
Been in fifteen states
Every woman seemed to fade out of my mind
I hit the bottle and hit the sack and cried
What′s all this laughter on the 22nd floor
It′s just some friends of mine
And they're busting down the door
Been a lonely night at the Memory Motel
You′re just a memory girl
Just a memory
And used to mean so much to me
You're just a memory girl
You′re just a memory
And it used to mean so much to me
You're just a memory girl
You just a memory
And used to mean so much to me
You′re just a memory
All the love that used to mean so much to me
•She got a mind of her own
And she use it well yeah
Mighty fine, she's one of a kind
