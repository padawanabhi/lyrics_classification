He rocks in the tree tops all day long
Hoppin′ and a-boppin' and singing his song
All the little birdies on Jaybird Street
Love to hear the robin go tweet, tweet, tweet

Rockin′ Robin, rock-rock
Rockin' Robin
Blow rockin' Robin
′Cause we′re really gonna rock tonight

Every little swallow, every chick-a-dee
Every little bird in the tall oak tree
The wise old owl, the big black crow
Flappin' their wings singing, "Go bird, go"




Rockin′ Robin, rock-rock
Rockin' Robin
Blow, rockin′ Robin
'Cause we′re really gonna rock tonight
Yeah, yeah!

Pretty little raven at the bird-band stand
Taught him how to do the bop, and it was grand
They started going steady and bless my soul
He out-bopped the buzzard and the oriole

He rocks in the tree tops all day long
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and singing his song
All the little birdies on Jaybird Street
Love to hear the robin go tweet, tweet, tweet

Rockin′ robin (tweet, tweedily dee), rock, rock
