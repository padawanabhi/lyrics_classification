Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor away
Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor away

I told my mama how I feel about your power
Your love can heal, no doctorâ€²s remedy
Ever do what you do for me

Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor away
Eeny weeny teeny bit of your love
Baby it is all I need, it is all I need




Since the day I have been loving you
I cannot catch a cold, I cannot catch the flu
The sweet loving you have been giving me
Has become my daily need

Just a little of your love, every day
It is all I need, that is all I need
Just a little bit baby
That is all I need, that is all I need

So do not send no doctor to my door
Because Doctor John has been here before
Do not you send him, just come yourself
Bring your love and nothing else




Ooh just a, just a
Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor away
Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor away
Jus a little bit
Just a little bit
