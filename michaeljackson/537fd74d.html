('Round and around and around, 'round)
People make the world go 'round
('Round and around and around, 'round)

Teachers on strike, no more school today
They want more money but the board won't pay
('Round and around and around, 'round, people)
Everybody's talkin' 'bout ecology
The air's so polluted that it's hard to breathe
(Air's so polluted that it's hard to breathe, people)

But that's what makes the world go 'round
The ups and downs a carousel
Changing people's heads around
Go underground young men
People make the world go 'round
(People make the world go 'round)




Old folks judge you by the clothes you wear
They'd swear you're a hippy if you have long hair
('Round and around and around, 'round, people)
Young politicians fight for poverty
While people still cry for equality
(People still cry for equality, people)

But that's what makes the world go 'round
The ups and downs a carousel
Changing people's heads around
Go underground young men
People make the world go 'round
(People make the world go 'round)

But that's what makes the world go 'round

Changing people's heads around
Go underground young men
People make the world go 'round
And around and around, 'round




People make the world go round
And around and around, 'round
People make the world go round
And around and around, 'round
People make the world go round
And around and around, 'round
