Can it be I stayed away too long
Did I leave your mind when I was gone
It′s not my thing trying to get back
But this time let me tell you where I'm at

You don′t have to worry 'cause I'm coming
Back to where I should have always stayed
And now I′ve heard the maybe to your story
And it′s enough love for me to stay

Can it be I stayed away too long
Did I leave your mind when I was gone
Well it's not my thing trying to get back
But this time let me tell you where I′m at




I wanna, wanna be where you are (oh)
Anywhere you are (oh oh oh)
I wanna, wanna be where you are (oh oohh)
Everywhere you are (oh oh oohh)

Please don't close the door to our future
There′s so many things we haven't tried
I could love you better than I used to
And give you all the love I have inside

I wanna, wanna be where you are
Any, any, anywhere you are
I wanna, wanna be where you are
I gotta, gotta be where you are

I want to be, I want to be (oh, yea, yea, baby now)
I want to be, I want to be (oh, oh)
I want to be, I want to be (oh, now, now, yeah, yeah)
I want to be, I want to be (oh)
I want to be, I want to be (oh, now, now, baby)
I want to be, I want to be (oh)
I want to be, I want to be (oh)
