Billie...

What do you want from me?
Why don′t you run from me?
What are you wondering?
What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me?
Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

Come here...

Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly?
You′re payin'?
Is the amount cleanin' you out
Am I satisfactory?
Today, I′m thinkin′ about
The things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin′ you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me




Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ahh-ha)
Cannibal class, killin' the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna–

What do you want from me?
Why don′t you run from me?
What are you wondering?
What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me?
Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

Listen...




Keep you in the dark, what had you expected?
Me to make you my art
And make you a star and get you connected?
I′ll meet you in the park
I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start
That you'd fall apart ′cause I′m too expensive
Your talk'll be somethin′ that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (Wow)
Callin′ security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury your friend right now

For the debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
′Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won′t close
And I can′t say no, I can't say no

Careful...

Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh-ha)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ahh-ha)
Cannibal class, killin′ the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna–

What do you want from me?
Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering?
What do you know?
Why aren′t you scared of me?
Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?
