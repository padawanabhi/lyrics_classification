Take me to the rooftop
I wanna see the world when I stop breathing
Turning blue
Tell me, love is endless, don′t be so pretentious
Leave me, like you do (like you do)

If you need me
Wanna see me
Better hurry
'Cause I′m leaving soon

Sorry, can't save me now
Sorry, I don't know how
Sorry, there′s no way out (sorry)
But down, mm down




Taste me, the salty tears on my cheek
That′s what a year-long headache does to you
I'm not okay, I feel so scattered
Don′t say I'm all that matters
Leave me
Deja vu

If you need me
Wanna see me
You better hurry
I′m leaving soon

Sorry, can't save me now
Sorry, I don′t know how (sorry)
Sorry, there's no way out (sorry)
But down, mm down

Call my friends and tell
Them that I love them
And I'll miss them
But I′m not sorry
Call my friends and tell them that I love them
And I′ll miss them
Sorry
