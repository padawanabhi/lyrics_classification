You can pretend you don′t miss me (Me)
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me (Me)
Oh, what a shame, I′m not there

You can pretend you don't miss me (Me)
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me (Me)
Oh, what a shame, I′m not there

What is it you want?
You can lie, but I know that you′re not fine
Every time you talk
You talk 'bout me, but you swear I′m not on your mind




You can pretend you don't miss me (Me)
You can pretend you don′t care
All you wanna do is kiss me (Me)
Oh, what a shame, I'm not there

Everybody knows
You and I are suicide and stolen art
Pretty mama sews
Stitches into all your bitches broken hearts

You can pretend you don′t miss me (Me)
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me (Me)
Oh, what a shame, I'm not there

Somebody new
Is gonna comfort you like you want me to
Somebody new
Is gonna comfort me like you never do




Every now and then, it hits me
That I′m the one that got away
But I guess being lonely fits me
And you were made for begging, stay
