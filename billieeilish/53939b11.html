Bite my tongue, bide my time
Wearing a warning sign
Wait ′til the world is mine
Visions I vandalize
Cold in my kingdom size
Fell for these ocean eyes

You should see me in a crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make ′em bow
One by, one by one, one by, one by
You should see me in a crown
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch me make 'em bow
One by, one by one, one by, one by one




Count my cards, watch them fall
Blood on a marble wall
I like the way they all
Scream
Tell me which one is worse
Living or dying first
Sleeping inside a hearse
(I don't dream)

You say, "Come over, baby
I think you′re pretty"
I′m okay, I'm not your baby
If you think I′m pretty

You should see me in a crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make ′em bow
One by, one by one, one by, one by
You should see me in a crown
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch me make 'em bow
One by, one by one, one by, one by one




Crown
I′m gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by, one by one, one by, one by
You should see me in a crown
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch me make 'em bow
One by, one by one, one by, one by one
