Wait a minute, let me finish
I know you don′t care
But can you listen?
I came committed, guess I overdid it
Wore my heart out on a chain
Around my neck, but now it's missing, hmm

Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da

So I think I better go
I never really know how to please you
You′re lookin' at me like I'm see-through
I guess I′m gonna go
I just never know how you feel
Do you even feel anything?

Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da




You said, "Don′t treat me badly"
But you said it so sadly
So I did the best I could
Not thinking you would have left me gladly

I know you're not sorry
Why should you be?
′Cause who am I to be in love
When your love never is for me?
Me

Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da

So I think I better go
I never really know how to please you
You're lookin′ at me like I'm see-through

I guess I′m gonna go
I just never know how you feel
Do you even feel anything?
