Told you not to worry
But maybe that′s a lie
Honey, what's your hurry?
Won′t you stay inside?
Remember not to get too close to stars
They're never gonna give you love like ours

Where did you go?
I should know, but it's cold
And I don′t wanna be lonely
So show me the way home
I can′t lose another life

Hurry, I'm worried
The world′s a little blurry
Or maybe it's my eyes
The friends I′ve had to bury
They keep me up at night




Said I couldn't love someone
′Cause I might break
If you're gonna die, not by mistake

So, where did you go?
I should know, but it's cold
And I don′t wanna be lonely
So tell me you′ll come home
Even if it's just a lie

I tried not to upset you
Let you, rescue, me the day I met you
I just wanted to protect you
But now I′ll never get to

Hurry, I'm worried

Where did you go?
I should know, but it′s cold
And I don't wanna be lonely
Was hoping you′d come home
I don't care if it's a lie
