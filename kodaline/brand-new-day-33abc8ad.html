Well, it's your hometown I think I've outgrown
I wanna travel the world but I, I just can't do it alone
So I'm just waiting on fate to come wrap around me
Think about all the foreign places we could be

I'll be flicking stones at your window
I'll be waiting outside 'til you're ready to go
Won't you come down? Come away with me
Just think of all the places we could be
I'll be waiting, waiting on a brand new day

Riding on waves, walking on sand
Digging in caves to find the treasures of the land
And if we find gold, well, we'll just throw it away
We can write stories bout the journeys that we made
(We could be big in Japan)




I'll be flicking stones at your window
I'll be waiting outside 'til you're ready to go
Won't you come down? Come away with me
Just think of all the places we could be
I'll be waiting, waiting on a brand new day
Waiting on a brand new day

They said they'll keep me here
But I couldn't do another year
I said I'll see you soon
Because I whistle to a different tune

Think of all the places we could be
Think of all the people we could meet

I'll be flicking stones at your window
I'll be waiting outside 'til you're ready to go
Won't you come down? Come away with me
Think of all the places we could be
I'll be waiting, waiting on a brand new day
