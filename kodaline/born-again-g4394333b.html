Here I go again
Reaching for the line
I fall back down to earth
Every single time
I found my oxygen
It brings me back to life
It always looks like you
Looks like you

You make me wanna be better
Taking me back to the life
We'll always be stronger together
Take on the world when you're mine
I never believed in heroes
But darkness can turn into light
I know this ain't never say never
But I'll never, ever




I won't stop fighting, but not
Fighting with you
I'll be fighting for you like I'm
Born again, born again
And I keep believing
'Til my heart stops beating
'Cause you got me feeling like I'm
Born again, born again

One day we'll be gone
We only get one life
We'll be the things we've done
And what we've left behind
The strength to carry on
In the back of my mind
It always looks like you
Looks like you

You make me wanna be better
Taking me back to the life
We'll always be stronger together
Take on the world when you're mine
I never believed in heroes
But darkness can turn into light
I know this ain't never say never
But I'll never, ever




I won't stop fighting, but not
Fighting with you
I'll be fighting for you like I'm
Born again, born again
And I keep believing
'Til my heart stops beating
'Cause you got me feeling like I'm
Born again, born again

Born again, born again
Born again, born again
Born again, born again
Born again, born again
Born again, born again
Born again, born again
Born again, born again
Born again, born again

I found my oxygen
To bring me back to life
It always looks like you

I won't stop fighting, but not
Fighting with you
I'll be fighting for you like I'm
Born again, born again
And I keep believing
'Til my heart stops beating
'Cause you got me feeling like I'm
Born again, born again

Born again, born again
Born again, born again
Born again, born again
Born again, born again
Born again, born again
Born again, born again
Born again, born again
Born again, born again
