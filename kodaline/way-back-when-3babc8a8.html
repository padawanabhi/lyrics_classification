We never had that much to do
So we just lay around in someone′s house
Someday I'll have it all again
Just like way back when

Back then we′d sleep until the afternoon
And we'd just get up and go outside
Open a window, let the breeze blow in
Forget everything

Yea, those will be the days that I will be missing
When I'm old and when I′m gray and when I stop working
I hope that I can say
When all my days are done
We were just having fun

Well we′d go drinking in the afternoon
Lie out on the grass and fall asleep
Oh will I ever see that girl again?
The girl from way back when




Yea, we used to share a cigarette
And throw together everything we had
And then go driving in my parents' car
And never strayed too far

Ho yeah
Those will be the days that I will be missing
When I′m old and when I'm gray and when I stop working
I hope that I can say
When all my days are done
That I had my fun

Those will be the days, I had my fun

Yea, in time can move so fast
Some things are made to last
So here′s to you, my dear old friend
From way back when

Yea, those will be the days that I will be missing
When I'm old and when I′m gray and when I stop working
I hope that I can say
When all my days are done
That I had my fun
