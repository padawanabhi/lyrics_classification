People keep talking
But I can′t hear a word they say
Life just keeps moving
The world gets stranger every day

And, yeah, "Time is on your side"
That's what people tell you
But I got to let you go

My head is saying that this is for the better
I just want you to know
I can′t hold on forever
When all I wanna do is let go
Oh, oh oh, oh oh oh
All I wanna do is let go
Oh, oh oh, oh oh oh




Sirens are screaming
But I can't hear a single sound
And I'm feeling uneasy
And I wait, and I wait for a change to come around

I get the feeling that this is for the better
And I just want you to know
I can′t hold on forever
When all I wanna do is let go
Oh, oh oh, oh oh oh
All I wanna do is let go
Oh, oh oh, oh oh oh

Are you searching for an answer
Or just peace of mind?
When your life has lost its meaning
Maybe you need a little time
