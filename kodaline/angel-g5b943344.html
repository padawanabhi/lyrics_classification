On a Wednesday morning in July
We dried our tears and we said goodbye
Another angel gone before her time
But she′s still alive in our hearts and minds

You never know, you never know
What you've got until it′s gone
But heaven knows that when we're old
She will be forever young

Tonight we send an angel home
Sing out and celebrate her song
Tonight she'll go where we can′t go
Sing out, sing out, sing out

And there are things in life we can′t explain
In the blink of an eye everything can change
So just appreciate the little things
'Cause you never know what tomorrow brings




[Pre-Chorus]You never know, you never know
What you′ve got until it's gone
But heaven knows that when we′re old
She will be forever young

Tonight we send an angel home
Sing out and celebrate her song
Tonight she'll go where we can′t go
Sing out, sing out, sing out

There's an empty room at home
How can the world be so damn cold?
Together we are not alone

Tonight we send an angel home
Sing out and celebrate her song
Tonight she'll go where we can′t go
Sing out, sing out, sing out

On a Wednesday morning in July
We dried our tears and we said goodbye
