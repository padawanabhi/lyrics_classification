The stars in the pavement
Are washed up and jaded
There′s blood on the streets of gold
The beautiful waitress
Who just couldn't make it
So far away from home

Are you strong enough? (Are you strong enough?)
Are you wise enough? (Are you wise enough?)
Are you giving up? (Are you giving up?)
Will you disappear?
When it comes to me (when it comes to me)
I don′t know, you see (I don't know, you see)
I don't wanna leave (I don′t wanna leave)
But I can′t stay




I don't know
If it′s worth it
Is it worth it?
I don't know
I don′t know
If it's worth it
Is it worth it?
I don′t know

I don't know
I don't know
(I don′t know)

No one can see them
The angels and demons
Are testing how low you go
Sunsets and sunsets
As dark as your heart gets
It′s best if you just say no

But are you strong enough? (Are you strong enough?)
Are you wise enough? (Are you wise enough?)
Are you giving up? (Are you giving up?)
Will you disappear?
When it comes to me (when it comes to me)
I don't know, you see (I don′t know, you see)
I don't wanna leave (I don′t wanna leave)
But I can't stay




I don′t know
If it's worth it
Is it worth it?
I don't know
I don′t know
If it′s worth it
Is it worth it?
I don't know, ah

Whoa
Is it worth it?
I don′t know
(I don't know)
(If I want it or if I don′t)
I don't know
(I don′t know)
(If it's far out or if it's close)

I don′t know
If it′s worth it
Is it worth it?
I don't know
I don′t know
If it's worth it
Is it worth it?
I don′t know

I don't know, woah
I don′t know
I don't know
(I don't know)
