When we were young, we were the ones
The kings and queens, oh yeah we ruled the world
We smoked cigarettes, man no regrets
Wish I could relive every single word

We′ve taken different paths and traveled different roads
I know we'll always end up on the same one when we′re old
And when you're in the trenches and you're under fire
I will cover you

If I was dying on my knees
You would be the one to rescue me
And if you were drowned at sea
I′d give you my lungs so you could breathe
I′ve got you, brother
I've got you, brother
I′ve got you, brother
I've got you, brother




Oh brother, we go deeper than the ink
Beneath the skin of our tattoos
No, we don′t share the same blood
You're my brother and I love you, that′s the truth

We're living different lives, heaven only knows
If we'll make it back with all our fingers and our toes
Five years, twenty years, come back
I′ll always be the same

If I was dying on my knees
You would be the one to rescue me
And if you were drowned at sea
I′d give you my lungs so you could breathe
I've got you, brother
I′ve got you, brother

And if we hit on troubled water
I'll be the one to keep you warm and safe
And we′ll be carrying each other
Until we say goodbye on our dying day

Because I've got you, brother
I′ve got you, brother
I've got you, brother
I've got you, brother




If I was dying on my knees
You would be the one to rescue me
And if you were drowned at sea
I′d give you my lungs so you could breathe

I′ve got you, brother
I've got you, brother
