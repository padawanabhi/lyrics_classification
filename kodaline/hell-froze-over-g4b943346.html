My house, I′m all alone
I got a picture on my telephone of you
This tree will never grow again
Our hearts are dominoes
Tumbleweeds on a desert road somewhere
Our love is coming to an end

And there's a part of me wishing
That you were standing here with me
But now my mind is moving down the road
It′s a new day beginning
But there's a piece of me clinging
To all the memories and episodes

I would do anything for you
But I won't do that again
We might never get closure
Heaven knows it had to end




There′s a part of me wishing
That you were standing here with me
But now I′m looking through another lens
Maybe if hell froze over
We could be in love again
Maybe if hell froze over
We could be in love again

Singing
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

We're drinking lemonade
It tastes bitter but we′re not afraid to speak
Our minds so honestly and true
I know when I'm 88
I′ll still remember all the better days
But right now, I gotta say goodbye

And there's a part of me wishing
That you were standing here with me
But now my mind is moving down the road
It′s a new day beginning
But there's a piece of me clinging
To all the memories and episodes

I would do anything for you
But I won't do that again
We might never get closure
Heaven knows it had to end




There′s a part of me wishing
That you were standing here with me
But now I′m looking through another lens
Maybe if hell froze over
We could be in love again

Singing
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

Woke up on a Saturday
Bought a ticket for an aeroplane
My golden getaway

I would do anything for you
But I won't do that again
We might never get closure
Heaven knows it had to end

There′s a part of me wishing
That you were standing here with me
But now I'm looking through another lens
Maybe if hell froze over
We could be in love again
Maybe if hell froze over
We could be in love again

Singing
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

Maybe if hell froze over
We could be in love again
