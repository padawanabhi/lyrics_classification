How many nights do you lie dreaming?
I'm counting the days since you went away
When I lost my heart, life lost all meaning
What I would give to see you again

I'll pray for you
Do you pray for me?
I'll pray for you




And you slipped away from me without talking
The look in your eye was stronger than words
And I drink alone to stop me from weeping
What's left of my heart is forever yours
Forever yours

I know, I'll pray for you
Do you pray for me?
I'll pray for you

I know, I know, I know, I know
