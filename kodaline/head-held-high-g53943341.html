La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la

Ever had a feeling that you can′t go on
Trying to be strong but getting weaker?
Carrying the weight of every single day
Having lost your way, feeling defeated

Sat staring, counting spiral patterns on the wall
You wonder if your luck is ever gonna turn around, but oh

You need a little light to guide the way
Waiting on the sun to shine again
You gotta keep your head up high
You gotta keep your head up high
You need a little hope to carry on
In the middle of the night when you're all alone
You gotta keep your head up high
You gotta keep your head up high




Your bedroom carpet stained with rosé wine
Empty′s left behind, the morning after
The distant purr of cars on soaking roads
And the street echoes, the noise of laughter

The bottom of the bottle, finds you almost every night
You wonder if your life is ever gonna turn out right again

You need a little light to guide the way
Waiting on the sun to shine again
You gotta keep your head up high
You gotta keep your head up high
You need a little hope to carry on
In the middle of the night when you're alone
You gotta keep your head up high
You gotta keep your head up high

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la

Confused and battered by the motion of the changing tides
You're nearing empty and you′ve barely got the will to fight
You wonder if you′re gonna live or if you will survive, oh




You need a little light to guide the way
Waiting on the sun to shine again
You gotta keep your head up high
You gotta keep your head up high
You need a little hope to carry on
In the middle of the night when you're alone
You gotta keep your head up high
You gotta keep your head up high

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
