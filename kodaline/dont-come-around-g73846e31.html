Don′t come around

Don't come around, what the hell?
You want me to wish you will
I don′t think I wish you well
I'm still hungry, can't you tell?
We′re still acting innocent
We both know that′s not your style
Assassinate me with a smile again

All, all that you want
Is someone to blame it all
If all you want
Is someone to say that you were never wrong

Don't come around here, don′t come around
When you're asking how am I doing now
Keep me run down
And say it loud
And shut it out
It′s over now

(Don't come around)




What was ours now is yours and mine
Someone had to draw the line
It hurts me every now and then
Thought that I was doing fine
Why you′re here, who let you in?
Why you're asking where I've been?
Know that I don′t need your sympathy

All, all that you want
Is someone to blame it all
If all you want
Is someone to say that you were never wrong

Don′t come around here, don't come around
When you′re asking how am I doing now
Keep me run down
And say it loud
And shut it out
It's over now

(Don′t come around)

(Don't come around)

Don′t come around here
Don't come around
When you're asking how am I doing now
Don′t come around here
Don′t come around
When you're asking how am I doing now




Keep me run down
And say it loud, and shut it out
It′s over now
