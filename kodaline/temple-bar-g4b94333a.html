Friday night and no one's home
There's no point in getting drunk alone
Grab your coat and make a call
I'll meet you down in temple bar

People come and people go
So raise a glass to who you know
When winter hasn't taken hold
So why do I feel so cold

Like a question without an answer
Like music without its dancers
Like a bird without a song
Tell me where did it all go wrong
Like a frame without a picture
Like God without a scripture
Like me when I know you're gone
Tell me where did it all go wrong

Oh where did it all go wrong, go wrong
Oh when did it all go wrong, go wrong




Saw a girl that I used to know
It's funny how the hearts moves on
She's got her home and a family
I get the feeling she's forgotten me

People leave their mark and go
Like footprints in the winter snow
When winter hasn't taken hold
So why do I feel so cold

Like a question without an answer
Like music without its dancers
Like a bird without a song
Tell me where did it all go wrong
Like a frame without a picture
Like God without a scripture
Like me when I know you're gone
Tell me where did it all go wrong

Oh where did it all go wrong, go wrong
Oh when did it all go wrong, go wrong




Like a question without an answer
Like music without its dancers
Like a bird without a song
Tell me where did it all go wrong
Like a frame without a picture
Like God without a scripture
Like me when I know you're gone
Tell me where did it all go wrong

Oh where did it all go wrong, go wrong
Oh when did it all go wrong, go wrong
