One day it′s here and then it's gone
How are you still holding on?
How are you still holding on?
You′ve felt this way for far too long
Waiting for a change to come
You know you're not the only one

And life, passes you by
Don't be wasting your time on your own

You′re always trying to see yourself
Through the eyes of someone else
Through the eyes of someone else
Too shy to say that you need help
You and everybody else
You and everybody else




Oh, life passes you by
Don′t waste your time on your own
Yeah, life, passes you by
Don't be wasting your time all alone

As your heart gets bigger
And you try to figure out
What it′s all about
And your skin gets thicker
As you try to figure out
What it's all about

Yeah, life, passes you by

Don′t waste your time on your own

One day it's here and then its gone
How are you still holding on?
How are you still holding on?
