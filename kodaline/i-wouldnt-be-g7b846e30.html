I wouldn′t be who I am, without you
I wouldn't sing the way I sing, without you
You fill my eyes up with color
And you′ll always be my mother
I wouldn't be who I am

I wouldn't be the son that I am
Without a father who showed me I can face all the bullies at school
You taught me how to keep my cool
I wouldn′t be who I am




I wouldn′t be the brother I am
Without a sister who understands my ambitions and dreams
We always were on the same team
I wouldn't be who I am

Without the people
We don′t see no more
And all the imperfections on my skin
The family tree, with its branches around me
Oh, I just wouldn't be who I am
I wouldn′t be who I am

I wouldn't be who I am
I wouldn′t be who I am




I wouldn't be the human I am
Without the friends that let me fly and help me land
Our foundations go deep
I'll always have a place to sleep
I wouldn′t be who I am
