I don′t wanna be the one to try
Being someone else is not my style
There's a missing piece I′m trying to find
I don't know how when you many don't twice

Sleep, I don′t need no sleep
Having such a week
I just wanna take off flying
High, higher than the birds
Words are only words
Take my hand and go there with me

There′s no hide and seek
I see you see me
What's the mystery
Give it up, let go

Somewhere in between
Feeling, make believe
You′ve got what I need
Give it up, let go




You keep on asking why you're still defied
I′m hanging on to see if we collide
And we don't need to know the place or time
As long as I am yours and you are mine

Sleep, I don′t need no sleep
Having such a week
I just wanna take off flying
High, higher than the birds
Words are only words
Take my hand and go there with me

There's no hide and seek
I see you see me
What's the mystery
Give it up, let go

Somewhere in between
Feeling, make believe
You′ve got what I need
Give it up, let go




There′s no hide and seek
I see you see me
What's the mystery
Give it up, let go
Somewhere in between
Feeling, make believe
You′ve got what I need
Give it up, let go

Sleep, I don't need no sleep
Having such a week
I just wanna take off flying
High, higher than the birds
Words are only words
Take my hand and go there with me

Oh, oh oh, oh oh oh

There′s no hide and seek
I see you see me
What's the mystery
Give it up, let go

Somewhere in between
Feeling, make believe
You′ve got what I need
Give it up, let go
