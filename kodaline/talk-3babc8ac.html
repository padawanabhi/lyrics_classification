I can remember the good old days
When you and me used to hide away
Where the stars were shining or the sun was blinding our eyes
Yeah, you filled up my glass
With promises that could never last
But I still find pieces of you in the back of my mind

And all of the things that we once said
Are not in my heart, they′re in my head
That was the time to say goodbye
Let's put it to rest, yeah, let it die

′Cause we don't, we don't need to talk about this now
Yeah, we′ve been down that road before
That was then and this is now
The crowds in my heart they′ve been calling out your name
Now we just don't feel the same
I guess it′s over, yeah, we're done




I heard you made your way downtown
To the place that we′ve been hanging around
I was looking for your face in the crowd but trying to keep my head down
Over time our wires crossed
Well, you changed and the truth got lost
All the things I would change if we could only rewind

You were a moment in life that comes and goes
The riddle, the rhyme that no one knows
A change of a heart, a twist of fate
Couldn't fix it, it′s too late

'Cause we don't, we don′t need to talk about this now
Yeah, we′ve been down that road before
That was then and this is now
The crowds in my heart they've been calling out your name
But it just don′t feel the same
I guess it's over, yeah, we′re done

Oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh
Oh

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh




(Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh)
We don't, we don′t need to talk about this now
(Oh oh oh oh, oh)
We don't, we don't need to talk about this now

We don′t, we don′t need to talk about this now
We don't, we don′t need to talk about this now
