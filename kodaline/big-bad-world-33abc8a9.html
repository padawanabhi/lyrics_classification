Maybe I′m wrong, or maybe I'm right
Maybe it′s just too late but this is keeping me awake all night
Maybe say yes, or maybe say no
Maybe I'm just too shy to admit that it is time to go

We go out on our own
It's a big bad world outside
Carrying′ our dreams and all that they mean
Trying to make it all worthwhile

Maybe believe, or maybe don′t care
Shit, maybe there is no God in the big white clouds up there
Maybe live long, or maybe die young
Or maybe live every day like it's your last day under the sun




We go out on our own
It′s a big bad world outside
Carrying our dreams and all that they mean
Trying to make it all worthwhile

We go out on our own
It's a big bad world outside
Carrying our dreams and all that they mean
Try to make it all feel right

We go out on our own
It′s a big bad world outside
Carrying our dreams and all that they mean
Trying to make it all worthwhile

We go out on our own
It's a big bad world outside
Carrying our dreams and all that they mean
Trying to make it all worthwhile
