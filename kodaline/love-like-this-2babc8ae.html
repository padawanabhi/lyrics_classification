Running through the heat heart beat
You shine like silver in the sunlight
You light up my cold heart
It feels right in the sun, the sun
We′re running around and around
Like nothing else could matter in our life
But wait, but wait, but wait
The sun will stop shining soon
And you'll be dark in my life
Yeah, you′ll be gone, it's as simple as a change of heart
But I'm not gonna think about the future

A love like this won′t last forever
I know that a love like this won′t last forever
But I, I don't really mind, I don′t really mind at all




Slipping into the night love
It grows dark but you don't mind
Hiding in the back streets, yeah, you′ll never notice me
All that I was thinking about was cleaning up my conscience
Lost in the memory as it shakes up the corners of my heart
Was it my mistake?
Or maybe it was just as simple as a change in your heart
Just as simple as a change in your heart

I know now a love like this won't last forever
I know that a love like this won′t last forever
But I, I know that a love like this won't last forever
I know that a love like this won't last forever
But I, and I

I don′t mind at all
A love like this won′t last forever
A love like this, a love like this
A love like this won't last forever
