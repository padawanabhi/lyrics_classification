Right about now NWA court is in full effect
Judge Dre presiding in the case of NWA versus the police department.
Prosecuting attourneys are MC Ren, Ice Cube and Eazy motherfuckin′ E
Order, order, order, Ice Cube take the motherfuckin' stand
Do you swear to tell the truth the whole truth
And nothin′ but the truth so help your black ass?
You goddamn right
Well, won't you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say?

Fuck the police comin' straight from the underground
A Young nigga got it bad ′cause I′m brown
And not the other color so police think
They have the authority to kill a minority
Fuck that shit, 'cause I ain′t the one
For a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun
To be beatin' on, and thrown in jail
We can go toe-to-toe in the middle of a cell




Fuckin with me ′cause I'm a teenager
With a little bit of gold and a pager
Searchin′ my car, lookin' for the product
Thinkin' every nigga is sellin′ narcotics

You′d rather see me in the pen
Than me and Lorenzo rollin' in the Benzo
Beat a police outta shape
And when I′m finished, bring the yellow tape
To tape off the scene of the slaughter
Still getting swole off bread and water

I don't know if they fags or what
Search a nigga down and grabbin′ his nuts
And on the other hand, without a gun, they can't get none
But don′t let it be a black and a white one
'Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top
Black police showin′ out for the white cop

Ice Cube will swarm
On any motherfucker in a blue uniform
Just ′cause I'm from the CPT, punk police are afraid of me
A young nigga on a warpath
And when I′m finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath
Of cops, dyin′ in L.A.
Yo Dre, I got somethin' to say




Fuck the police, fuck-, fuck-
Fuck the police, fuck-, fuck-
Fuck the police, fuck the-, fuck the-
Fuck the police (Example of scene one)

Pull your goddamn ass over right now
Aw shit, now what the fuck you pullin′ me over for?
'Cause I feel like it
Just sit your ass on the curb and shut the fuck up
Man, fuck this shit
Alright, smart-ass, I'm taking your black ass to jail
MC Ren, will you please give your testimony
To the jury about this fucked up incident

Fuck the police and Ren said it with authority
Because the niggas on the street is a majority
A gang, is with whoever I′m steppin′
And the motherfuckin' weapon is kept in
A stash spot, for the so-called law
Wishin′ Ren was a nigga that they never saw

Lights start flashin' behind me
But they′re scared of a nigga so they mace me to blind me
But that shit don't work, I just laugh
Because it gives ′em a hint not to step in my path
For police, I'm sayin', "Fuck you, punk"
Readin′ my rights and shit, it′s all junk
Pullin' out a silly club, so you stand
With a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand

But take off the gun so you can see what′s up
And we'll go at it, punk, I′ma fuck you up
Make ya think I'm a kick your ass
But drop your gat, and Ren′s gonna blast
I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime
But I'm a smoke ′em now, and not next time

Smoke any motherfucker that sweats me
Or any asshole that threatens me
I′m a sniper with a hell of a scope
Takin' out a cop or two, they can′t cope with me

The motherfuckin' villian that′s mad
With potential to get bad as fuck
So I'm a turn it around
Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound
Yeah, somethin′ like that, but it all depends on the size of the gat
Takin' out a police would make my day
But a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck to say

Fuck the police, fuck-, fuck-
Fuck the police, fuck-, fuck-
Fuck the police, fuck the-, fuck the-
Fuck the police

Yeah, man, what you need?
Police, open now (Aww, shit)
We have a warrant for Eazy-E′s arrest
Get down and put your hands right where I can see ′em!
Man, what the fuck did I do? Man, what did I do?
Just shut the fuck up and get your motherfucking ass on the floor!
But I didn't do shit
Man, just shut the fuck up!
Eazy-E, won′t you step up to the stand
And tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit?

I'm tired of the motherfuckin′ jackin'
Sweatin′ my gang while I'm chillin' in the shack, and
Shining the light in my face, and for what?
Maybe it′s because I kick so much butt
I kick ass, or maybe ′cause I blast
On a stupid ass nigga when I'm playin′ with the trigger

Of any Uzi or an AK
'Cause the police always got somethin′ stupid to say
They put up my picture with silence
'Cause my identity by itself causes violence
The E with the criminal behavior
Yeah, I′m a gangster, but still, I got flavor

Without a gun and a badge, what do ya got?
A sucka in a uniform waitin' to get shot
By me, or another nigga.
And with a gat, it don't matter if he′s smarter or bigger
(Size don′t mean shit, he's from the old school, fool)

And as you all know, E′s here to rule
Whenever I'm rollin′, keep lookin in the mirror
And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a
Dumb motherfucker with a gun
And if I'm rollin′ off the eight, he'll be the one
That I take out, and then get away
While I'm drivin off laughin′
This is what I′ll say

Fuck the police, fuck-, fuck-
Fuck the police, fuck-
Fuck the police, fuck-, fuck-
Fuck the police (The verdict)

The jury has found you guilty of being a redneck
Whitebread, chicken shit motherfucker
Wait, that's a lie, that′s a goddamn lie
Get him out of here (I want justice)
Get him the fuck out my face (I want justice)
Out, right now
Fuck you, you black motherfuckers

Fuck the police
Fuck the police
Fuck the police
