A message to Benedict Arnold
No matter how hard you try to be
Here′s what they think about you

Hello, I was at The Celebrity
And I was wonderin' why that punk Ice Cube got his ass beat by ATL

Yo, that nigga was sayin′ he from Compton, he ain't from Compton
He from a planet called, "Punk", it is full of pussy protein and pearl tongue




All I wanna know is why ya'll let his punk-ass in the group in the first place
When you knew what kinda bitch he was?

Yeah, I was in the new music seminar in New York
And I watched that punk motherfucker run
While the rest of his homeboys got they ass beat

Hello, I′m callin′ to say since Ice Cube was suckin' so much New York dick
Can he come and eat some of this Chicago pussy?
(I smell pussy)

Yeah, nigga when we see yo′ ass, we gon' cut your hair off
And fuck you with a broomstick

Think about it, punk motherfucker
