The muthafuckin′ saga continues

Die nigga
Where I'm born
And died nigga
You′ve been diein' for 400 years
Niggaz know how to die
Niggaz don't know nothin′ else
But dying
Niggaz dream about dyiqng

Im a muthafuckin′ nigga
With an attitude
I'm a muthafuckin′ nigga
With an attitude
I'm a muthafuckin′ nigga
With an attitude
I'm a muthafuckin′ nigga
With an attitude




I got a case of spittin' in a muthafucker's face
So me and my ace
We got a taste of a muthafucker′s billy club
He took his gun and put it to my head and said, "Nigga start runnin′"

So tell me what's the next episode?
Is he crazy, does he want to chase me and waste me?
I thought, ′Run nigga, run' but I caught myself
Because my secondary thought was death

I get hit hard real, but still muthafucker said
"I want another black muthafucker dead
Niggaz ain′t good for shit to me
'Cause it′s a race for second class
So get your ass up against the wall bitch"

And then he tried, they jumped me but the punk became a victim of a walkby
Fuckin' with Dre, you get a foot up in your asshole
It's just another way to let you know

I never said, I never said, I never said, ok can′t fuck wit me
Real muthafuckin′ G
Straight from the streets of the CPT
Tellin' you why real niggaz don′t die

I just want to celebrate
I just want to celebrate




Real niggaz don't die
′Cause they eventually multiply
The niggaz I'm with, they take an eye for an eye
Because the times are so wrong
Got to stay so strong
Niggaz got to keep it goin′ on and on

And don't let no pail face
They throw your ass in a snail race
Have your residents occupyin' a jail space
That′s what they want to do ′cause the system is fucked around
I try to let you know what the record it's underground

They don′t give a fuck about a nigga
They would rather pull the trigger and have you in front of a barrel
Smilin' sayin′, "Cheese"
So nigga get smart and rebel back
I'm not wit that black shit so I′m not gonna yell that

All I see is niggaz gettin' harassed
We can't do nothin′ about it but get a foot in they ass, yo
But if every nigga grabbed a nine
And started shootin′ muthafuckers, it would put them in line

And that's how it′s supposed to be
When the pussy ass niggas try to fuck wit me
Yo, because it's useless to try
To kill a nigga ′cause nigga a muthafuckin' a real nigga don′t die

I just want to celebrate
I just want to celebrate

Damn nigga, everywhere you go niggas dyin here
Niggas been dying for 400 years
I'm a muthafuckin' nigga
Wth an attitude

Only the good die young, so they make me young and bad
Puttin′ ass kickin′s on the niggaz that never had
So I guess that makes me tough shit
Straight up gangsta, wrong nigga to fuck with

So how can a nigga die when he's causin′ the bloodshed
By shootin' muthafuckas in the head
Tryin′ to make a nigga extinct because they fear me
But never want to hear me

So I'ma let ′em know how a nigga's livin'
Checkin′ for muthafuckas cause nobody ain′t givin' a damn thing
To a nigga, a real nigga
So I′m livin' by the muthafuckin′ trigger

'Cause a nigga ain′t afraid of bein' locked up
I'm out of luck, so why should I give a fuck
But they still want to try
To kill a nigga like me but muthafuckin′ real niggaz don′t die

I just want to celebrate
I just want to celebrate
I just want to celebrate
I just want to celebrate
Die nigga
