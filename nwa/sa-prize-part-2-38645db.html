Police Department, Sergeant Kickass speaking
Yeah, Kickass, it′s me again
Hold on, hold on a fucking minute
What the fuck is your problem? I told you not to call me here
This better be some good shit

Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got a big one
It's going down tonight, but it′s gon' cost you two thousand
You cluckin' motherfucker
Listen, if you wanna make the deal you fat motherfucker
It′s at 477 Savona Way, 4 a.m., and don′t fuck me

Hey, I don't feel good about this one man
Hey, we′ve been doing this for fuckin' ten years
And we haven′t been caught yet
Yeah, I just don't know about this one
Hey, just shut the fuck up and pass me a donut




(Specially called photo sessions where he recieved a copy of that famous-)
Yeah, what′s happening?
Hey, what's up Dre?
Hey yo doc what's happenin′ man, did you hit that shit up with 5.0?
I′ll vish' it up man, it′s just jumpin' off tonight
It oughta be happenin′ about four in the morning
Aw, here we got something for the ass

Quiet, quiet
Sa said this was gonna be pretty easy
Yeah, but never underestimate those fuckin' niggas
Right, are you ready?
Yeah, as ready as I′ll ever be

Alright, on three
One, two, three
Freeze motherfuckers
Shoot that motherfucker, gas motherfucker police
Broke motherfucker
Surprise, niggas

Fuck the police (yeah, come one)
(Fuck, fuck) fuck the police
Fuck the motherfuckers
Fuck the police (come on, come on, come on)
(The big payback) you're motherfuckin' right, yo




Fuck the motherfucking police
They don′t want peace, they want a nigga deceased
So he′ll cease to be a problem, and by the way they perform
It seems the Klan gave the white police another uniform
And yo the black police, the house niggaz
They gave you a motherfucking gun, so I guess you figure
You made out, good to go, but you didn't know
They would stick your black ass back in the ghetto, yo

To kill another nigga, catch him with crack, in fact
Freebase, they put in the neighborhood in the first place
But the brothers ain′t stupid, remember that
You got a gat, I got a gat, so wassup with that
A to the motherfuckin K
The last words you hear, then the smoke appears
Tears, from your motherfuckin family
They're starin′ at me, but I'm goin′ gun happy, fuck 'em

Shootin' everything in sight, tonight′s the night to get hyped
And fight for what′s wrong, fuck what's right
And by the way, my name is Dre
So listen up motherfuckers to what I gotta say, yo

Fuck the police
(Fuck, fuck) fuck the police
Fuck the police
(Fuck, fuck) fuck the police
(Now for the first episode)

Yeah that shit′s hittin' man
Where′s the volume on this motherfucker at?
Hold-up, hold-up, hold-up, one-time, one-time, one-time
Put the joint out, put the joint out
Hey you motherfuckers want to step out of the car?
Don't you know it′s against the law to play music so goddamn loud?
Shut the fuck up! Go to jail? Gimme that shit you was just smoking

Motherfuckers that from high crime areas
View the police as a threat
And that's some shit you better not forget

Eazy E's the name feared by most
When a lil′ nigga is thrown in the pen
But on the streets there′s two kinds of people
White rich fucks and the ones who get harassed like me
Pull over to the side, routine for me
Tearin' up my shit, like they lookin′ for a key of cocaine
But they never find the shit
Ain't got nothin′ better to do and nobody else to fuck wit'

Thinkin′ everything is stolen
But can't face facts that a young black nigga's just rollin′
Making more money than they ever make
Taking more shit than they ever take
Yo pigs are made to kill, and no regret and
Keep your hand on your weapon, shoot his ass and start steppin′
'Cause I′m a nigga that don't give a fuck about nothin′
So let me explain a lil' somethin, yo

See, I got this problem, a big problem
Cops don′t like me, so I don't like motherfucking cops

Fuck the police
(Fuck, fuck) fuck the police
Fuck the police
(Fuck, fuck) fuck the police

Get out of the fuckin' car
Wait a goddamn minute, what the hell did I do?
Hey just shut the fuck up, black bitch
Wait a minute, you ain′t gotta be pullin′ me by my motherfuckin hair!
Let go of my motherfuckin' hair

Hey just step the fuck back and shut up
Get your motherfuckin hands off of me
Calm down, calm down now
Listen, we′re gonna go around this corner
And you're gonna suck me and my partner′s dicks
Or you're gonna be one black dead nigger bitch

Police brutality is common in my neighborhood
That′s why I hate them motherfuckers

I said fuck the police but with a little more force
And maybe now I get my point across
It's a lot here that's goin′ on, just open your eyes and look
Every day a young nigga is took
Off the face of the street by a police
It′s like they gotta a nigga chained on a short leash
You can't leave out the city that they shacked up
′Cause if you do that, the right they got you jacked up

It's embarassin′ because you know they justice
But all you do is say, "Fuck this"
Because if you move, that's all she wrote
So what? The excuse to shoot, or they rather stomp your head
′Til you're dead with the steel toe boot
Harassin' me with some kind of mind game
Actin′ like a nigga just was born with a gang-name
You call that rights but when you′re black there's no right
Some recreational shit was only a gang fight

So shootin′ at the cops was a street thing
To waste time as we sling dope and cocaine
But everything was done just for peace
To retaliate on the fuckin' police, so I′m sayin'

Fuck the police
(Fuck, fuck) fuck the police
Fuck the police
(Fuck, fuck) fuck the police
(The final episode)

Hey Juan, look at that piece of ass, man
Watch out, watch out, watch out homies
Oh shit man you fucked up, you hit a police car
I didn′t see that piece of caca
Better act like you don't speak inglés homes

What the fuck? Get your ass out of there, I've had enough
Of your raggedy ass motherfucking shit
No man, no me pegan, por qué me pegan, no! Por favor, no, no!
Por qué?

Fuck the police
(Fuck, fuck) fuck the police
Fuck the police
Fuck the police

Fuck the police
(Fuck, fuck) fuck the police
Fuck the police
Fuck the police

Chinga tu pinche madre
Pinches policías weyes pendejos
Salvajes culeros
