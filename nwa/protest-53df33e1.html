Then he get′s excited (balance and illustration)
And that's tomorrow′s forecast, back to you Jim
Thanks, Dick! Now we have our man
Hale Anderson live at the arena for tonight's N.W.A concert
What's goin′ on down there, Hale?




Well, Jim, the riders are gettin′ pretty rowdy here
I see a couple of fights here and I hear the authorities comin' on their way
Because, uh, there appears to be some people in black hats standing on the roof
Uh, I hear gunshots, Jim, uh... (oh my god!)
Please duck, duck, everyone duck, oh wait, wait
Oh, who wants to bleed, I′ve just been hit
Someone gunning for too much, like, get the fucking camera off
Hey hot stuff, stop the fucking camera!
I've been hit! Shit, man, shit, let′s go!
I'm talkin′ man just go! Fuck! Turn the fucking camera off
You motherfucker
