Ah yeah, right about now Compton′s in the motherfuckin' house yeah do it, do it, do it
N.W.A is in full effect
Ayo, Yella boy, kick me that funky-ass beat right here
Kick that shit in
Yeah, yeah
Pump it up, pump it up
Who′s in the motherfuckin' house right now? Who's in the house?
(Compton′s in the motherfuckin′ house)
Pump that shit up, c'mon
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Compton′s definitely in the motherfuckin' house
Ayo Ren, what we gon′ do?




To the people over here
To the people over there
To the people, the people, the people, people, the people, the people, people
From everywhere watching the show
Paying top dollars because they know
When we're on the stage, we′re in a muthafuckin' rage
So Dre
What up?
Why don't you get the 12 gauge

Yeah
And show ′em how Eazy-Duz-It
So if you punks wanna make somethin′ of it
Step up, run up, get up, what's up, suckers?
You want some of this?
Then you′re a stupid motherfucker

Kickin', like the kick from a kickdrum
Yella boy on the drum gettin′ dumb
Programmin', a beat that′s hittin'
And if you listen then you know we're not bullshittin′

Dope, like a pound or a key (yeah)
So shut the fuck up and listen to me
I make a killin′
I got money to the ceilin' (why′s that?)
'Cause I′m a motherfuckin' ruthless villain
MC Ren, stomping any fool in my way
With some help from my homeboy Dre




Now my name is Dre the muthafuckin′ doctor
Rippin' shit up, oh yeah, and here to rock ya
With some help from my homeboy E
The criminal of the Ruthless posse
Fuckin' it up, (word up), is what we do
The reputation of the NWA crew
Gettin′ busy because we′re cold stompin'
And we′re born and raised
And we're born and raised
And we′re born and raised in Compton

Speaking of Compton, it's making me sick (why?)
Everybody′s talking that crazy shit
Saying they were raised in the CPT (uh-huh)
Just as I was, they try to be like me
Poppin' that shit, get the fuck out my face
Knowin' that they never even seen the place
Claiming my city, it′s my city they claim
Motherfucker, we′re about to put some salt in your game

Yeah, I'm tired of these muthafuckas running around town
Talking about they′re from Compton and shit
Trying to get on the bandwagon
Yeah Dre, I know what you're saying, man
But let′s tell them who we're talking about, on the one

What do you call a crew that can rap like that?
Yo, N.W.A call them mothafuckers wack
Yeah, you know what time it is, listen to why we call them wack

They got a wacky wack record with a wacky wack crew
Yo, what about the lyrics?
That shit′s wacky wack too
With a fucked up style and a fucked up show
Ayo Ren, what about the scratching, is it def?
Fuck no
The motherfuckin' record is so muthafuckin' wack
The motherfuckin′ Cracker Jack needs to step the fuck back (back)

Do you want some of this?
("Hell no, he replied")
Dre, the muthafuckin′ doctor
Well, for the record, it's Ren, and for the street, it′s Villain
Dre, the muthafuckin' doctor
Well, for the record, it′s Ren, and for the street, it's Villain
Yella boy, why don′t you kick me one of them funky-ass beats?
My boy, my boy, my boy Ice Cube
Yo, we got my homeboy Eazy-E in the house
Won't you tell 'em what your name is?

MC Ren is the muthafucking coroner (yeah)
I′m getting rid of muthafuckas as if they was a foreigner
Show no grief to pretend when I sin
I punch you can block it but I′ma still get in
This ain't a TKO in the first
But it′s some shit from a nigga in black and much worse
Than a beating from Tyson 'cause Ren is not nice and
Your ass is better off just rolling a dice and

Finding you a number for luck
′Cause you will need it when you see I don't give a fuck
My identity, and the shit is getting shown
Without a video I′m still getting known (yeah)
I'm at a show then my picture is taken
One click of the flash and punk niggas are breakin'
To the door, tryin′ to join my fan club
Lip-syncin′ over one of my dubs
An instrumental will scratch for the moment
Until I fuck up the so called opponent

That's standing in the zone of the twilight
Saying, "How in the fuck did he get mixed up in my fight?"
It wasn′t a mistake, it was a set-up
So until I'm finished pumpin′ my lyrics, you should shut up
And don't attempt to speak
Because it′s bad enough you're rollin' up shit creek
With a nigga like Ren about the hit
Now let me hear you muthafuckas talk some more shit
Or I′ma, bust your ass in your mouth
Yo, unless you′re saying, "Compton's in the house"

Who really cares, about a sucker on a take off
Bust a move, we can have a shake and bake-off
Me and you can go ′cause I don't care
Yo, rap fight or guerrilla warfare
We can rumble, ′cause when my lungs go in and out
I kick rhymes in a bundle to win a bout
Or scurry or scuffle
I just muffle the opposition, there's no competition
Let them know that Dre is getting stronger
Compton′s in the house but now it's some' longer

I won′t get set-up, shut up, I′m kinda fed up
You can say uncle and I still won't let up
′Cause Dre is the muthafuckin' doctor
And if me and Ren′s on the mic, it's like propaganda no doubt
Boy, you should′ve known by now
("Compton's in the house")

Yeah, it's time to put Compton on the map
So don′t ever think you can get it none, you stupid motherfuckers
("Compton-comp-comp-comp-Compton′s in the house")
("Compton-comp-comp-comp-Compton")
("Comp-comp-comp-comp-Compton")
("Comp-comp-comp-comp-Compton's in the house")
("Compton-comp-comp-comp-Compton")
("Comp-comp-comp-comp-Compton")
("Comp-comp-comp-comp-Compton′s in the house")
