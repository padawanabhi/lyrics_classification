What you want is an unexpected approach
That may delay a suspects awareness of your presence
Until you have a chance to assist the situation you are confronted

Approach to danger, don′t move
It's hard to predict what will happen next
(Oh shit, he has a gun!) Drop the gun
You could′ve prevented a tragedy




You can approach, but the danger-light is blinking
A self-desctruct button is activated when I'm thinking
This is a tribulation, the weakened judge
The prophecy was fulfilled 'cause I never budge
I took up the tools, crucifixion was the extreme
They′re seeing doubles of me, but it wasn′t a dream
One vision was of life, the other was death
Then I didn't give a fuck if death took your last breath
So you burn in my pit that I call hell
Where you got send because your shit don′t sell
My twenty-twenty was blurry from the smoke
Of the niggaz that I burned and tormented but I didn't choke
I started doing ′em, I kept on doing 'em
Do ′em for shoot 'em up till that nigga Ren was booing 'em
And my presence to the suckers was of a stranger
But fuck it, they can approach to the danger

If you can be seen, you can be hit
If you can be hit, you can be killed
(He′s on the line! Shoot him!)

Fatal approach to danger, just to remain a strangeler
Outrun, the shot of a gun with a gangsta

Murder in the first degree, but it′s worse to be
A dead motherfucker or a nigga in custody
With everybody thinking of death I kept working
To be one of the last niggaz left
So many people looking for hope, they're broke
Without checking the fingerprints on the motherfuckers′ throat
A heart of steal can reveil the real nigga in me
So figuring to see the D-E-A-D
Bodies like a nigga's straight walking in a cemetary
So it′s very necesarry to carry ammunition for niggaz wishing
But they better take caution, before Dre goes off
And starts killing motherfuckers
Just in order to change the anger for the real nigga
When I approach to danger




Approach the motherfucking danger
Come back to hell and send me some time... (This is it y'all)

Final approach to danger, death, destruction around every corner
Another dead body and you wanna keep running
But even the rain turns black
All you can do is stay alert to try to say out of the search-light
No prison, nobody makes bail
Everybody gotta go but see, it ain′t no jail
Think about death, taking your last breath
Heart beating like a motherfucker like there ain't no time left.
For so many ways to stay up, I gotta get mine
Even though they wanna make a crime
Yo, I'm being real, a better or latter in the beginning
Because it will release the fucking police
Fuck ′em, I approach to danger
′Cause I don't give a fuck if somebody gotta get fucked up
So you might as well kiss your ass goodbye
′Cause in the long run... (We'll all die)
