It was once said by a man who couldn′t quit
"Dopeman, please can I have another hit?"
The dope man said, "Clucka, I don't give a shit
If your girl kneel down and sucked my dick"
It all happened and the guy tried to choke her
Nigga didn′t care, she ain't nothing but a smoker
That's the way it goes, that′s the name of the game
Young brother getting over by slanging caine
Gold around his neck in 14 k heaven
Bitches jocking on his dick 24-7
Plus he′s making money keeping the base heads waiting
Rollin 6.4. with the fresh ass daytons


Living in Compton, California CA
His Uzi up yo ass if he don't get paid
Nigga begging for credit, he′s knocking out teeth
Clocking much dollars on the 1st and 15th
Big wad of money, nothing less than a twenty
Yo, you want a five-oh? The dope man's got plenty
To be a dope man, boy, you must qualify
Don′t get high off your own supply
From a key to a g it's all about money
10 piece for 10 base, pipe comes free
And people out there are not hip to the fact
If you see someone getting money for crack, he′s the




Dopeman, dopeman!
Hey man give me a hit
Dopeman, dopeman!
Yo man fuck that shit
Dopeman, dopeman!
We just can't quit
Dopeman, dopeman!
Well, suck this bitch!

Wait a minute -- who the fuck are you talking to?
Do you know who the fuck I am?
Man, I can't believe this shit -- this bitch is trying to gank me
I′ll slap you up side your head with nine inches of limp dick!

You need a nigga with money so you get a dopeman
Juice that fool for as much as you can
She likes his car and he gets with her
Got a black eye cause the dopeman hit her
Let that slide and you pay it no mind
Find that he′s slapping you all the time
But that's okay, cause he′s so rich
And you ain't nothing but a dopeman′s bitch!
Do what he say and you keep your mouth shut
Popping that trash might get you fucked up
You'll sit and cry if the dope man strikes you
He don′t give a fuck -- he got two just like you
There's a another girl in the dopeman's life
Not quite a bitch but far from a wife
Shes called the strawberry and everybody know
Strawberry, strawberry is the neighborhood ho
Do anything for a hit or two
Give tha bitch a rock, she′ll fuck the whole damn crew
It might be your wife and it might make you sick
Come home and see her mouth on the dopeman′s dick
Strawberry just look and you'll see her
But don′t fuck around or she'll give you gonorrhea
And people out there are not hip to the fact
That Strawberry is a girl selling pussy for crack to the

Dopeman, dopeman!
Hey man give me a hit
Dopeman, dopeman!
Hey yo man fuck that shit
Dopeman, dopeman!
In yo face
Yo Dre, kick in tha bass

If you smoke ′caine, you're a stupid motherfucker
Known around the hood as the schoolyard clucker
Doing that crack with all the money you got
On your hands and knees searching for a piece of rock
Jonesing for a hit and you′re looking for more
Done stole a Alpine of out Eazy's 6-4
You need your ass whooped cause it's out of this earth
Can′t get a 10 piece need a dolla fifty′s worth
Knucklehead nigga, yeah, you turned into a crook
But swear up and down, boy, that you ain't hooked
You beat your friend up and you whooped his ass long
Cause he hit the pipe till the rock was all gone
You′re robbing and stealing, bugging and illing
While the dope man's dealing
What is killing your pain, cocaine, this shit′s insane
Yo, E, she's a berry lets run a train

Man, I wouldn′t touch that bitch

Me neither; Ho, go home and wash out your beaver
And niggas out there messing up people's health
Yo, what the fuck yo gotta say for yourself?

Well, I'm the dopeman -- yeah, boy, wear corduroy
Money up to here but unemployed
You keep smoking that rock and my pocket′s getting bigger

Yo, got that five-0 -- double up, nigga

Yeah, high rolling, big money I′m folding
Bitch on my tip for the dick I'm holding
Strung strawberry jocking me so early
Ho, you want a hit you gotta get your knees dirty
Well, that′s my life that how it's cut

Hey, dopeman!

Bitch, shut the fuck up
Gotta make a run, it′s a big money deal
Gankers got the fake but you can get the real from the

Dopeman, dopeman!
Yeah, that's me
Dopeman, dopeman!
Yo, can I get a "g"?
Dopeman, dopeman!
Clock as much as he can
Fuck this shit, who am I?
THE DOPEMAN!

Yo, mister dopeman, you think you′re slick
You sold crack to my sister and now she's sick
If she happens to die because of your drug
I'm putting in your culo a .38 slug!
