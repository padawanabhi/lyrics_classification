One, two, three, kick it

Ay-yo Dre, what′s goin' on, man? What′s goin' on?
Ay, what y'all gonna do for this last record?
Nah, tell me what y′all gonna do?

Okay, you want me to do the intro? Aight!

Parental discretion is advised for the moment
While I′m gettin' candid, now understand it
Ain′t too typical in any way, though the pro
On the mic is the D.O. to the C., this is an intro
I know the DOC makes you want to take a valium
So buy a bucket, cause upcomin' is my album
And for the record, meanin′ my record, check it
Listen to the single and you'll be like, "Yo, I gotta get it"
But in the meantime, listen to the rhyme
Of the Dr. Dre, played with N.W.A.

Yella′s on the drum roll, rockin' the beat
Ay-yo Dre, where're you gonna take this shit, man?




Ay-yo, let′s take it to the street (word up), let ′em understand perfection
Let knowledge be the tool for suckers to stop guessin'
Cause I don′t give a fuck about a radio play
Observe the English I display
Lyrics for the adults, children have been barred
And scarred from listenin' to somethin so motherfuckin′ hard
Dope, pumpin' that so my shit will never falter
Yo, it′s Dre, so fuck the "Mind of Minolta"
Psycho, like no other motherfucker
So step to me wrong, G-O for what you N-O
But be warned, never will I leave like a regular
'Cause I'm a little better than a regular competitor
I used to see ′em on stage
Earnin′ money like a thief, but without a gauge
Until I got full of clockin' the lane, gettin pulled
(They said you wasn′t gon' get paid) Nah, that′s bullshit!
They like it stylistic
And I enchant the crowd like I'm a mystic
(C-C-C-C) C-C-C-cameras are flashin′ when I'm in action
A photo or fresh with a flair for fashion
Pure simplicity, see it's elementary

You hear one of the hardest motherfuckers this century
Try to comprise a word to the wise and the guys
Parental discretion is advised

Ren is most extremely high performance
The black hat ′cause I worn this, ′cause it's like enormous
Some shit, I don′t take it, not even in a toilet
And shit from a sucker, put in a pot and I'll boil it
Turn up the pilot as it burns
And maybe the motherfuckers will learn
I′m not a sub, cause I speak sensible
Not considered a prince, cause I'm a principal
I′m engineerin' the shit that you're hearin′
′Cause when it comes to power, I'm power steerin′
Silly you say? I say you're silly when you say it
Rushin′ to the eject to put my shit in and play it
It's like Apollo, but I′m not a amateur
And I'm not givin' a fuck while I′m damagin′ ya
It's for the record, so Ren′s lyrics is gonna spin it
And if it was a trophy involved, I'd win it




Possession is mine and I′m the holder
'Cause a nigga like Ren don′t give a fuck 'cause I'm older
So for you to step off would be wise
And say fuck it, parental discretion is advised

I be what is known as a bandit
You gotta hand it to me when you truly understand it
′Cause if you fail to see, read it in braile
It′ll still be funky, so what's next is the flex
Of a genius, my rapid-stutter steppin′, if you seen this
Dope, you hope that I don't really mean this
But if played, made the grade of high-top fade
It′s not my trademark when I get loose in the dark
You guess it was a test of a different style
It's just another motherfucker on the pile
Drivin′ your ass with the flow of your tongue
You hung yourself short, the after-knowledge was brung
To your attention by the hardest motherfuckin' artist
That is know for lynchin' any sucker in a minute
Stagger ′em all

When I start flowin like Niagara Falls
Ice Cube is equipped to rip shit in a battle
Move like a snake when I′m mad, and then my tail rattle
I get low on the flow, so let your kids know
When I bust, parental discretion is a must

Little did they know that I would be arrivin'
And it′s surprisin', rockin′ it from where I been
But it's the E here to take, no mistakes to be made
In the trade where funky ass records are bein′ played
Fuck the regular, yo as I get better the
Bitches wanna trick and go stupid up on the dick
So I get 'em hot, thinkin' they′re gonna get it
As they sit, rubbin′ their legs like a cricket
To you it may be funny, but
There's no service of beef without money

So slip the C-note, and you can choke
On a wing-ding-ding-a-ling down your throat
Foreplay to me ain′t shit
When you spread 'em, I′m ready, then you can get the dick
Of the Eaze, if you can deal with the size
But if you can't, parental discretion′s advised!

Shut the fuck up!!
