The motherfucking saga continues

All of you who don′t believe in the real gangsta shit
'Cause when it comes to the real niggas
It makes the shit that much harder to deal with
Yeah, above the laws in this motherfucker
Like Mafia for life, down with the real niggas for life
Ha-ha, yo sweet-talk, tell ′em what the fuck we're here for

Well I write ya, USE, Compton, Watts, The Wood
All across the motherfucking USA
They know I walk through the valley of real niggas
I should fear no man on the motherfucking planet, hit me one
'Cause I′ve been to the mountaintop y′all
And I done seen through the eyes of a real nigga

Yo, what you think about the real niggas 187?
Yo, they make some of the coolest shit I done ever heard
Yo, won't meet KMG, I almost gave it up
To the ruthless motherfucking gangstas
Fear no mob




Because you′ve saved man yourself
Time to put the world at yourself man
Me not seen the bomboclaat mob to see a pussy-clot run
Bob-bob-bob-bob-bob, keep Babylon on the run, see

The real niggas is back
'Cause there′s too many bullshit records out
Niggas beat it for what we put out
But you don't have to wait no longer
Because the new album is out and the shit is much stronger
So many groups made three albums or more
And their weak-ass shit is still sitting in the record-store
They wonder why it never sold
Niggas rapping since the seventies and still never went gold

Our first record sold two million copies
That′s because you other motherfuckers are sloppy
You came out the streets and crossed over
And after that your career is fucking over
Because of that you're not around
So shut the fuck up, and witness the sound of some real niggas

Yeah, motherfucker
Keeping all you busters on the run in '91
Kick that shit, Ren




Most niggas can′t understand
And never will if they ain′t part of the ruthless Mafia-clan
Niggas is dedicated to the streets
With hyped fucking lyrics and a dope ass beat
The songs will never come soft, because I come off
So don't get in my way ′cause motherfucker you'll be cut off
And it′s something you can move your lips to
To wrap around my dick, to suck if it fits you

And let me now if you wanna ride the D-I-C-K
All day, that's with no play
′Cause ain't no rap groups out that I know
That makes me wanna listen to the radio
All I hear is motherfuckers tryna make a comeback
With love songs and that shit is whack
And that's why your ass ain′t around
′Cause you don't have the motherfucking sound of a real nigga
