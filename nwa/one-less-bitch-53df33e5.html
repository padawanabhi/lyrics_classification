The world′s most dangerous group
Once again beating on your motherfucking eardrums
Doing much damage for all you slutty ass hoes




Yo, there was a bitch I knew on the avenue
She was good to G-O for a nut or two yo
I think her name was Clara
And she was guaranteed to give a motherfucka whatever he needs
To be perfectly honest, she was a hooker
So I took her a hundred yards, to the boulevard
I told her "I'll take care of you, you take care of me"
"You′ve got a P-I-M-P and all I want is the money"
She went to work and the niggas were fiendin'
Yo, she had the biggest ass that you ever seen
In fact she was like Medusa, with titties full grown
One look and your dick turns to stone, yeah
Keepin' in mind that she was the kind that would find the time to get mine
Because she knows I′m not to be fucked with
She ain′t crazy
Fuckin' with Dre, she′ll be pushin' up daisies
She was the perfect ho, but wouldn′t you know
The bitch tried to gank me, so
I had to kill her
Yeah, straight hittin'
Now listen up and lemme tell you how I did it
Yo, I tied her to the bed, I was thinking the worst
But yo, I had to let my niggas fuck her first yeah
Loaded up the forty-fo′, yo
Then I straight smoked the ho
'Cause I'm a real nigga, but I guess you figured
I was soft and she thank me
Coughed to the boss and got tossed
One less bitch you gotta worry about
She′s outta here and that′s how it turns out




Now Vicky Vicky Vicky, she's very tricky
She put her hickey on top of my dick, sick bitch, see?
She told me she loved me and she wanted to keep me
If only she can have the dick weekly
I said I′m with it but baby you gotta hold up
If I was happy with somethin' that I could fold up
We can do this - she said her husband was rich
Then I knew I had the bitch
Yo she wrote a cheque, many a cheque
In the name of a bitch who was strugglin′ at the same game
All I wanted to do was get P-A-I-D
Just a little somethin' for fuckin′ me
Yo Everything was cool but Vicky concerned me
Her husband was the District Attorney
So, before he found out he was crossed up
By his bitch I was fuckin' I had her tossed up
And put to sleep, so a nigga never forgets
A dead bitch can't tell a nigga shit
One less bitch you gotta worry about
She′s outta here and that′s how it turned out

One less, one less
One less bitch you gotta worry about (motherfuckin' right)
One less, one less
One less bitch you gotta worry about

Thinkin′ about money, and lookin' at a prostitute
The bitch was cute, so now I had to execute
And shoot game like a real nigga
With a steel trigga
Convince her to move up to somethin′ bigger
I think I had a flashback though
'Cause I said "fuck it"
Loped and choked and smoked to the ho′ like this:
"Bitch, it's all about Dre"
"The money, money, money and this all I gotta say"
Of course she came with me and remained with me
'Till the bitch felt lamed and ashamed to be
Workin′ that trick shit
′Cause niggas knew that she was short one
A little later though she caught one
In the chest and I knew that it was commin'
By who and how the all act would be done?
So what? One less bitch I gotta worry about
But that ain′t how it turned out

Yo, there was a bitch named her out and shot her
Straight to the muthafuckin' trigger and said "I got her!"
But I had better plans to give her the blues
Like dumpin′ her in the river with cement shoes
I knew my money was comin' up short
And the thought that the stupid bitch thought she′d never get caught
Came home early and straight bust her ass
On the couch with her other nigga countin' my cash
I should've known she was like them other hoes
I told the two motherfuckaz to take off their clothes
Butt naked, nothin′ left but the shoes
I had up a nine so they couldn′t refuse
I shot the nigga, he was outta there
And tied up the bitch to the motherfuckin' chair
Now there′s one less bitch I gotta worry about
Everybody out, that's how it turns out

One less, one less
One less bitch you gotta worry about (in reality)
One less, one less (a fool is the one who believes)
One less bitch you gotta worry about (that all women are ladies)

A nigga is one who believes that all ladies are bitches
And all bitches are created equal
To me, all bitches are the same
Money-hungry, scandalous groupie hoes
That′s always ridin' on a nigga′s dick, always in a nigga's pocket
And when the nigga runs out of money the bitch is gone in the wind
To me, all bitches ain't shit

One less, one less
One less bitch you gotta worry about
One less, one less
One less bitch you gotta worry about
