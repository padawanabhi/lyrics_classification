(Listen to this) yo Ren
Wassup?
Take (one)
Yo (hit it)

Ruthless, plenty of that and much more
So at the party, Ren is controllin′ the floor
That you step and do your dance routine
It ain't a dream my man, you′re in a gangsta scene
With a villain doin' damage on a 24 track
With confusion to finish my conclusion
Arhytomatic rhymes from a radio cat
You can't take what I got ′cause I′ll be takin it right back




(Ruthless gangster) cold killin'
You wanna know what it′s means? (Definition: villain)
With the stupid dope rhyme
So once you hear one line you can tell it's mine
With a baseball cap that′s black that I'm wearin′
And a look that keeps you all starin'
And wondering why I'm invincible
But when you hear my rhyme, it′s convincible

I don′t take no shorts while I'm constructin′ the ground
That makes y'all move around to my hell of a sound
Girls drool on me like a dyin′
(Yo Ren, tell 'em what they do when you start rhymin′)
I go to the party, I hip a hop the spot
I dunno what it is, but the girls get hot
Perspirin' like they're on fire and
Their so-called boyfriends with ′em are retirin′
And for this reason I'm a walkin threat

So when I′m on stage I want
Quiet on tha set

(Light, camera, action)
N.W.A. take (two)




Now to get started with my musical profession
A gangsta or villain in mine is in session
The way that I'm referrin′ to this makes ya move ya butt
But don't stand in a daze, yeah you should know what′s up
Anyway I keep the clappin' along
'Cause nothing bad could go wrong because this song is so strong
I′m a Toyota, who could ask for anything more?
When N.W.A. is cold rockin′ the floor

Like stupid, actin' like a retard
Waitin′ for a bumrush, gettin' to the good part
It tempts me so with temptation
Writin′ my lyrics with this hyped information
This intersection of my creation
So don't say, "Shh" with an explanation
Just look at the center of the stage where the spotlight shines

Boy you shoulda known by now
It′s mine
Unpredictable, keepin' you extremely enjoyed
It's irresistable, meanin′ that you can′t avoid
And while I'm on stage, look forward to sweat

But after I rip it up I want (shh)
Quiet on tha set

(Light, camera, action)
N.W.A. take (three)

I can be loud as hell, think I will? (Never)
(Ssh, quiet on tha set)
Yeah I like that better
It′s what I can do, I think I earn respect
And if I didn't from you, that′s what I expect
'Cause if it ain′t ruff it ain't me
So who really cares how you want me to be?

See, I'm just me standin′ at the top of the pile
And doin′ soft known tunes, it ain't my style
And this concludes our program
Of how N.W.A. makes a ruthless jam
Now first, we take an average drum
Give it to Dre, and the boy gets dumb

It′s no secret, that I sit alone at night
Pick up a pad and pen and begin to write
All kinda lyrics that's promised to play
To make everybody say:
"They can be cold and ruthless, no question about that
But sometimes it′s more complicated"

Yo Dre (you know what I want you to do?)
Bring that beat back, bring that beat back
Now MC Ren is here workin' like super glue
No matter what I do, I′m always thinkin' o' you
′Cause I′m the pusher, supplyin' the fix
And this jam′s so dope, it don't need a remix
But I′m makin' obstacles of enemy traps
To catch any MC with the weakest raps

Crucifyin′ they vain like just for usin' my name
The definition is pain, but that's the thing o′ the game
If they try to retreat, I catch ′em one at a time
'Cause they′re committin' a crime, and still promotin′ a rhyme

So, you're in the back of me, just listen and learn
Because you′ll all get a chance or maybe a turn
Now my sideman wants to give a preview
So at my next concert, I wanna see you there
Not sittin' in the chair, standin' on yo′ feet
With yo′ hands in the air
Now I'm about to jet out but I′ll be back
But next time expect the more funkier track

Deep down for your enjoyment to hear more percussion
With lyrics that's smooth to start some discussion
The beat that I′m (hype) and you know that's bad
Now continue to dance ′cause I'm through with the set
