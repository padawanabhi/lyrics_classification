Yo, give me somethin′ to dance to

Calling the police, calling the g-men
Calling all Americans to war in the underworld

Arabian Prince, back wit' a style that′s hype
Not slow and low, it's the fast type
Gettin' dumped, can you hear the drums?
Yo Dre, why don′t you pump it up some?
I pumped it up so now what′s up?
Yo Yella boy, add a little cut
What the hell, you think we need some bells?
Yeah, homeboy, might as well

There it is, so now what's next?
A little sss-
So find me a ho, wait a minute
You need somethin′ else then
This is what I want you to do
Feel the groove, bust a move

Yo, yo, I'm tired, what about you?
Man this is somethin′ to dance to




Man that's wack, everybody used that
Yo, why don′t you bring back the other track?
Yeah there you go, that's what I'm sayin′
I like it when that dope stuffs playin′
Real loud, in your ear hole
Man let's go, I think my feet are swoll′
From dancin' so damn much
Man, I don′t give a- what?

You wanna leave?
With all these females pullin' on my sleeve?
I bet, you can jet, homeboy, no sweat
This is what I want you to do
Feel the groove, bust a move
(Here I come to see the dance)

This is somethin′ to dance to

Let the bass kick
This is somethin to (dance to)
Th-th-this is somethin' to (dance to)
Th-th-this is somethin' to (dance to)
Th-th-this is somethin′ to (dance to)
Th-th-this is somethin′ to (dance to)
Th-th-this is somethin' to (dance to)
Th-th-this is somethin′ to (dance to)
