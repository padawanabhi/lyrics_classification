Cry, baby, cry
Make your mother sigh
She′s old enough to know better

The king of Marigold was in the kitchen
Cooking breakfast for the queen
The queen was in the parlour
Playing piano for the children of the king

Cry, baby, cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry, baby, cry

The king was in the garden
Picking flowers for a friend who came to play
The queen was in the playroom
Painting pictures for the children′s holiday

Cry, baby, cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry, baby, cry




The duchess of Kirkcaldy always smiling
And arriving late for tea
The duke was having problems
With a message at the local bird and bee

Cry, baby, cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry, baby, cry

At twelve o′clock a meeting ′round the table
For a séance in the dark
With voices out of nowhere
Put on specially by the children for a lark

Cry, baby, cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry, baby, cry

Cry, cry, cry, baby
Make your mother sigh
She′s old enough to know better
Cry, baby, cry




Cry, cry, cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry, baby, cry

Can you take me back
Where I came from?
Can you take me back?

Can you take me back
Where I came from?
Brother, can you take me back?
Can you take me back?

Mm, can you take me
Where I came from?
Can you take me
Back?
