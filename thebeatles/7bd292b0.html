She′s not a girl who misses much
Do-do-do-do-do-do, oh yeah
She's well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand
Like a lizard on a window pane

The man in the crowd with the multicoloured mirrors
On his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy
Working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which he ate
And donated to the National Trust

I need a fix ′cause I'm going down
Down to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix 'cause I′m going down
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun




Happiness is a warm gun
(Bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
Happiness is a warm gun, momma
(Bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
(When I hold you in my arms)
Oooh, oh yeah!
And when I feel my finger on your trigger
Oooh, oh yeah!
I know nobody can do me no harm
Ooh, oh yeah!

Because
Happiness is a warm gun, momma
(Bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
Happiness is a warm gun
(Bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
Yes it is, gun!
Happiness (yes, it is) gun!

Happiness
(Bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
But don′t you know that happiness
Happiness is a warm gun, momma
Is a warm gun, yeahh!
