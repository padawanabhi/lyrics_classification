I look at you all
See the love there that′s sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps

I look at the floor
And I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps

I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don′t know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you

I look at the world
And I notice, it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps




With every mistake
We must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps

I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don′t know how you were inverted
No one alerted you

I look from the wings
At the play you are staging
While my guitar gently weeps

′Cause I'm sitting here
Doing nothing but aging
Still my guitar gently weeps

Dub the mic on the piano and quite low this
Just keep it in my maracas, you know
You know, those old pianos

Okay, we′re on
Mouth
