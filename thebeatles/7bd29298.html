Half of what I say is meaningless
But I say it just to reach you, Julia

Julia, Julia
Oceanchild calls me
So I sing the song of love
Julia

Julia, seashell eyes
Windy smile calls me
So I sing the song of love
Julia

Her hair of floating sky is shimmering
Glimmering in the Sun




Julia, Julia
Morning moon touch me
So I sing the song of love
Julia

When I cannot sing my heart
I can only speak my mind
Julia

Julia, sleeping sand, silent cloud
Touch me
So I sing a song of love
Julia

Hmm hmm hmm
Calls me
So I sing the song of love for
Julia, Julia, Julia
