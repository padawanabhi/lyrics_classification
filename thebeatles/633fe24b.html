She looks as an African Queen
She eating twelve chapattis and cream
She tastes as Mongolian lamb
She coming from out of Bahrain




What a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame Mary Jane
What a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
She like to be married with Yetti
He grooving such cooky spaghetti
She jumping as Mexican bean
To make that her body more thin

What a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame Mary Jane
What a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party

She catch Patagonian pancake
With that one and gin party makes
She having all the ways good contact
She making with apple and contract




What a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame Mary Jane
What a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
All together now
