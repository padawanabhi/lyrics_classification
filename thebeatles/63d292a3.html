Sexy Sadie, what have you done?
You made a fool of everyone

You made a fool of everyone
Sexy Sadie, oh, what have you done?

Sexy Sadie, you broke the rules
You laid it down for all to see
You laid it down for all to see
Sexy Sadie, oh, you broke the rules

One sunny day, the world was waiting for a lover
She came along to turn on everyone
Sexy Sadie (Sexy Sadie)
The greatest (She′s the greatest) of them all




Sexy Sadie, how did you know
The world was waiting just for you?
The world was waiting just for you
Sexy Sadie, oh, how did you know?

Sexy Sadie, you'll get yours yet
However big you think you are
However big you think you are
Sexy Sadie, oh, you′ll get yours yet

(Sexy Sadie) We gave her everything we owned just to sit at her table
Just a smile would lighten everything
Sexy Sadie (Sexy Sadie)
She's the latest and the greatest (She's the greatest) of them all
(Sexy Sadie)
(She′s the latest and the greatest of them all)

Woo

She made a fool of everyone

However big you think you are
(Sexy Sadie)
