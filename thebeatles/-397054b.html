I′ve got a feeling
A feeling deep inside, oh, yeah
(Oh, yeah, that's right)
I′ve got a feeling
A feeling I can't hide, oh, no, no
Oh, no
Oh, no
Yeah, yeah, I've got a feeling, yeah

Oh, please, believe me
I′d hate to miss the train, oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
And if you leave me
I won′t be late again, oh, no
Oh, no
Oh, no
Yeah, yeah, I've got a feeling, yeah
I got a feeling




All these years I′ve been wandering around
Wondering how come nobody told me
All that I was looking for was somebody who looked like you

I've got a feeling
That keeps me on my toes, oh, yeah
(Oh, yeah) Oh, yeah
I′ve got a feeling
I think that everybody knows, oh, yeah
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Yeah, yeah, I have got a feeling, yeah

Everybody had a hard year
Everybody had a good time
Everybody had a wet dream
Everybody saw the sun shine
Oh, yeah, (oh, yeah) oh, yeah, oh, yeah

Everybody had a good year
Everybody let their hair down
Everybody pulled their socks up (yeah)
Everybody put their foot down, oh, yeah

(Yeah)
(Woo-hoo!)
