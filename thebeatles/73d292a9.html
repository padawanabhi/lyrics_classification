She was a working girl
North of England way
Now she′s hit the big time
In the U.S.A.
And if she could only hear me
This is what I'd say

Honey Pie
You are making me crazy
I′m in love, but I'm lazy
So won't you please come home?

Oh, Honey Pie
My position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
Of your Hollywood song




You became a legend of the silver screen
And now the thought of meeting you, makes me weak in the knees

Oh, Honey Pie
You are driving me frantic
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong
Honey Pie, come back to me

I like it like that (Ooh)
I like this kind of hot kind of music
Hot kind of music
Play it to me, play it to me
Hollywood blues

Will the wind that blew her boat across the sea
Kindly send her sailing back to me?




Now, Honey Pie
You are making me crazy
I′m in love, but I′m lazy
So won't you please come home?
